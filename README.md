## Multimeter Arduino Project

This project showcases a simple multimeter built using Arduino. It measures voltage, current, and resistance and displays the readings on an LCD screen.

### Features

- Measures voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R)
- Displays readings on an LCD screen
- Easy to build and use

### Requirements

- Arduino board
- LCD display
- Resistors
- Current sensor (e.g., ACS712)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

### Installation

1. Connect the components as per the provided circuit diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino sketch (`multimeter.ino`) to your Arduino board.
3. Ensure all connections are correct and secure.

### Usage

1. Power on the Arduino board.
2. The multimeter will start measuring automatically.
3. View the readings on the LCD screen.
